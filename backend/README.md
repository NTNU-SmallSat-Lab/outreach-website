# Dev Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file and paste it as a `.env`. Now edit all the example `toBeModified` values to random strings.

The random strings should be generated using `openssl rand -base64 32` on macos and linux to ensure security as specified [here](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/migration/v4/migration-guide-4.0.6-to-4.1.8#setting-secrets-for-non-development-environments).

Now continue with the guide underneath.
