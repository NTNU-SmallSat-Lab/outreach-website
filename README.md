## Contributing

To ensure a consistent coding style, we have used Prettier to enforce code formatting.
Please install the Prettier extension for VSCode. Prettier can be configured to run on save, or it can be ran manually with the command

```
npx prettier --write
```

This will automatically format the code according to the rules set up for this project. The specific formatting rules have been defined here:

```
./frontend/prettierrc
```

Prettier has been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check code formatting during pull requests.
