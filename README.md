## Project Title
Hypso Outreach Portal

## Description
In January 2022, NTNU SmallSatLab launched Norway's first research satellite, the 6U HYPSO-1 CubeSat, equipped with a hyperspectral camera for ocean observation. Later the same year, Orbit NTNU launched the SelfieSat. With several more satellites planned, we aim to develop an interactive webpage for public outreach about our project. This page will showcase various elements such as a mission tracker, mission status with nerdy counters, satellite maps, and the possibility to post blogs or images.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an interactive web page for the general public.
- Consider elements like mission tracker, mission status, maps, and automatic posting features.
- Evaluate technology and framework choices, considering operational cost and maintenance simplicity.

## Additional Notes
- Location: Trondheim, with potential work at SmallSatLab.
- Encouragement to join SmallSatLab team events.
- Usage of NTNU-hosted web server and GitHub for code deployment.
