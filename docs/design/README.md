# Info about the design folder

Welcome to our design folder! This folder is dedicated to storing and organizing the design iterations and resources for our current project.

## Repository Structure

This Folder is organized into the following folders:

1. **Iterasjon1**: This folder contains the initial design concepts and drafts for the project. It includes early-stage sketches, wireframes, and basic prototypes.

2. **Iterasjon2**: Here, you will find the refined designs that were developed based on feedback and further brainstorming from Iterasjon1. This includes more detailed prototypes, higher fidelity wireframes, and potentially some initial UI elements.

## Accessing Design Files

In addition to the above folders, we have a central Figma document that contains all our design work in a more interactive format. This document is regularly updated with the latest design iterations and ideas.
